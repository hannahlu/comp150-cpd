<h3>Week 1: 19 September</h3>
<h4>Progress:</h4> 
•	Met classmates

•	Worked in teams to program a Lego Mindstorms Robot. Use of trial and error was effective in programming our robot and our team managed to complete all the tasks in the demonstration.

<h4>Challenges:</h4>
•	Anxiety at starting a new course and meeting new people. 

•	Accuracy needed to complete the Space Challenge tasks. 

•	Keeping consistent concentration during lectures.

<h4>Action:</h4>
•	To improve anxiety, getting used to the environment and routine of classes should help.


<h3>Week 2: 26 September</h3>
<h4>Progress:</h4> 
•	Practiced game ideation and designing paper prototypes.

•	Read first research paper.

<h4>Challenges:</h4>
•	Spending majority of our allocated time on game ideation rather than building a working prototype.

•	Finding research paper, ‘Why does a physical system compute’ intimidating, and delaying completion.

<h4>Action:</h4>
•	Make use of mind-maps to note group member’s ideas and help form a cohesive concept.

•	Limit time spent on ideation and focus on creating a working prototype to demo to rest of class.

•	Continue through harder parts of paper, the information may become clearer in later sections. Try to avoid feeling panicked if at first I do not understand.

<h3>Week 3: 3 October</h3>
<h4>Progress</h4>
•	Designed paper prototype for text-based adventure game.

<h4>Challenges</h4>
•	Narrowing down ideas into a cohesive concept in our team.

•	Being overambitious by trying to create both a paper and program prototype in class.

•	Understanding purpose and writing style of User Stories.

<h4>Action</h4>
•	Appoint someone to lead game ideation and prototype design.
