# comp150-cpd

<h3>Week 1: 19 September</h3>
<h4>Progress:</h4> 
•	Met classmates

•	Worked in teams to program a Lego Mindstorms Robot. Use of trial and error was effective in programming our robot and our team managed to complete all the tasks in the demonstration.

<h4>Challenges:</h4>
•	Anxiety at starting a new course and meeting new people. 

•	Accuracy needed to complete the Space Challenge tasks. 

•	Keeping consistent concentration during lectures.

<h4>Action:</h4>
•	To improve anxiety, getting used to the environment and routine of classes should help.


<h3>Week 2: 26 September</h3>
<h4>Progress:</h4> 
•	Practiced game ideation and designing paper prototypes.

•	Read first research paper.

<h4>Challenges:</h4>
•	Spending majority of our allocated time on game ideation rather than building a working prototype.

•	Finding research paper, ‘Why does a physical system compute’ intimidating, and delaying completion.

<h4>Action:</h4>
•	Make use of mind-maps to note group member’s ideas and help form a cohesive concept.

•	Limit time spent on ideation and focus on creating a working prototype to demo to rest of class.

•	Continue through harder parts of paper, the information may become clearer in later sections. Try to avoid feeling panicked if at first I do not understand.

<h3>Week 3: 3 October</h3>
<h4>Progress</h4>
•	Designed paper prototype for text-based adventure game.

<h4>Challenges</h4>
•	Narrowing down ideas into a cohesive concept in our team.

•	Being overambitious by trying to create both a paper and program prototype in class.

•	Understanding purpose and writing style of User Stories.

<h4>Action</h4>
•	Appoint someone to lead game ideation and prototype design.

•	Use mind-map to take note of everyone’s ideas.

•	Read up on User Stories.

<h3>Week 4: 10 October</h3>
<h4>Progress</h4>
•	Improved understanding of computer logic gates and memory.

•	Started using version control in GitHub.

<h4>Challenges</h4>
•	Concentration in lecture on manipulating graphics.

<h4>Action</h4>
•	Go over session slides for Comp120 class.

•	Set up a session with pair programming group.

<h3>Week 5: 17 October</h3>
<h4>Progress</h4>
•	Delivered pitch for game concept to class.

<h4>Challenges</h4>
•	Pitch was to short and noise of handout due to shaking was distracting.

<h4>Action</h4>
•	Printing off more handouts for pitch, to help audience take in information and get a better idea of concept.

•	Don’t just read off handout, try to memorise pitch and add more information than contained in handout.

•	Develop techniques for managing nerves when presenting a pitch.

<h3>Week 6: 24 October</h3>
<h4>Progress</h4>
•	Had first team stand-up meeting.

•	Began using Trello.

<h4>Challenges</h4>
•	Finding it difficult to write code during class sessions rather than at home.

<h4>Action</h4>
•	Try and use time constructively in class, if behind, first go over what I am unsure on before moving onto class task.

<h3>Week 7: 31 October</h3>
<h4>Progress</h4>
•	Presented proposals for Agile essays.

•	Peer-Reviewed Tinkering Graphics code.

<h4>Challenges</h4>
•	Reviewing code of my peer’s, was difficult as was unsure of PEP 8 guidelines.

•	Anxiety making it difficult to concentrate in lectures.

<h4>Action</h4>
•	Using Study Skills sessions to find techniques for managing anxiety.

•	Reading up on PEP 8 guidelines and implementing in my own Tinkering Graphics code.

<h3>Week 8: 7 November</h3>
<h4>Progress</h4>
•	First sprint review. 

•	Began coding audio.

<h4>Challenges</h4>
•	Our User Stories were too broad.

•	Had too many User Stories in our sprint backlog.

•	Found it difficult to understand task set in Tinkering Audio.

<h4>Action</h4>
•	Set less tasks in sprint backlog and be more realistic about time restraints in a sprint.

•	Go over session slides from Comp120.

•	Define exactly what is needed to complete a User Story.
