# comp150-cpd

## Week 1: 19 September
This week we worked in teams to build and program a Lego Mindstorm Robot.  Although I was apprehensive about the teamwork, I managed to participate. On the Monday, we had a lecture, which I found harder than the Lego Robot workshops. I find it difficult to concentrate in the lecture and seminar rooms as everyone is bunched up together and there is less personal space. To manage this, it is best to keep up attendance so that I am used to the routine and environment.

## Week 2: 26 September
During class, we were asked to develop a paper prototype for a board game. It proved difficult to move from game ideation to game design, and to narrow down our ideas. Once the prototype was completed, we had to present our pitches to the class, which was a daunting prospect. Outside of class, I have found the assigned research paper, ‘When does a physical system compute?’, challenging. Having now finished the paper, I know in future to just push on through the tougher sections, as it often will start to make more sense as I go on.

## Week 3: 3 October
In our Comp 110 class, we covered basic flowcharts and pseudocode. In a team, we had to develop a prototype for a text-based adventure game. Again, it was challenging to sync up all our ideas and to move from ideation to creating a working prototype. We also covered the Agile Manifesto, SCRUM and user stories. I am a little confused on how to use user stories and from what point of view to write them. We began using the PyGame library for python. I need to put some extra study time into learning Python, PyCharm and PyGame.

## Week 4: 10 October
This week we studied computer logic gates and memory, I found this lecture helpful and was more able to focus as we were back in the teaching space. We also learnt about version control with GitHub and Tortoise Git. We managed to sync our code during the lecture but I would like to go through the GitHub tutorials on YouTube and practice doing version control at home, to feel more confident with this.

## Week 5: 17 October
Delivering game pitches was a challenge for this week, my pitch was too short and holding the handout was distracting. All the same, it was a big step for me to speak at all. For next time, a few improvements include: ensuring I have at least 10 printed handouts, not holding my handout and instead adding information in my pitch, not already contained in handout. A slight issue with the pitch timing, is that my body was shaking so hard I am not sure I could have spoken much longer, with practice I should get more used to speaking and hopefully the shaking will calm down. I also need to work on my concentration in the lecture/seminar rooms as I missed quite a bit of this week’s lecture. This is mainly due to proximity to other people and the only solution is to get used to it.
