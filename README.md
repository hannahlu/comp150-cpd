<h3>Week 1: 19 September</h3>
<h4>Progress:</h4> 
•	Met classmates

<h4>Challenges:</h4>
•	Anxiety at starting a new course and meeting new people. 

•	Accuracy needed to complete the Space Challenge tasks. 

•	Keeping consistent concentration during lectures.

<h4>Action:</h4>
•	To improve anxiety, getting used to the environment and routine of classes should help.


<h3>Week 2: 26 September</h3>
<h4>Progress:</h4> 
•	Practiced game ideation and designing paper prototypes.

•	Read first research paper.

<h4>Challenges:</h4>
•	Spending majority of our allocated time on game ideation rather than building a working prototype.

•	Finding research paper, ‘Why does a physical system compute’ intimidating, and delaying completion.

<h4>Action:</h4>
•	Make use of mind-maps to note group member’s ideas and help form a cohesive concept.

•	Limit time spent on ideation and focus on creating a working prototype to demo to rest of class.

•	Continue through harder parts of paper, the information may become clearer in later sections. Try to avoid feeling panicked if at first I do not understand.
