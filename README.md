# comp150-cpd

## Week 1: 19 September
<h4>Progress:</h4> 
•	Met classmates

•	Worked in teams to program a Lego Mindstorms Robot. Use of trial and error was effective in programming our robot and our team managed to complete all the tasks in the demonstration.

<h4>Challenges:</h4>
•	Anxiety at starting a new course and meeting new people. 

•	Accuracy needed to complete the Space Challenge tasks. 

•	Keeping consistent concentration during lectures.

<h4>Action:</h4>
•	To improve anxiety, getting used to the environment and routine of classes should help.


## Week 2: 26 September
In teams, we were asked to design prototypes for two different board games. On the first game, we did not manage to complete a working prototype of the game, as we spent too long on ideation. For the next game, we prioritised designing the paper prototype, making it possible to present our concept to the class. I found the first few sections of the research paper, 'When does a physical system compute?', challenging and I delayed reading on. However, having now finished the paper, I have found that earlier sections became clearer as I progressed. For the next assigned paper, I will try not to panic if at first I do not fully understand it.

## Week 3: 3 October
For this week’s assignment, I found it difficult to write the pseudocode without a bias towards Python. Looking at examples of pseudocode online helped me find more universal terms. During our text-based adventure game task, my team and I struggled to narrow down our ideas and to move from ideation to creating a working prototype. We had experienced similar problems last week, so it is important to address this. In regards to this week's task, we made things more complicated than necessary, by trying to design both a paper and a program prototype. Had we focused on just the paper prototype we could have created a functioning prototype in the time given. I also need to improve my understanding of how to use User Stories effectively and to practice using the PyGame library at home. 

## Week 4: 10 October
This week we studied computer logic gates and memory. We also learnt about version control with GitHub and Tortoise Git.  I struggled to keep up with the presentation and the pair programming tasks in the COMP 120 class. In my own time, I need to go over the session slides and practice the coding activities.

## Week 5: 17 October
Delivering game pitches was a challenge for this week, my pitch was too short and holding the handout was distracting. All the same, it was a big step for me to speak at all. For next time, a few improvements include: ensuring I have printed enough handouts for the class, not using my handout as a prompt and providing extra information in my pitch. I was shaking quite badly during the pitch which made it difficult to focus, hopefully this will get better with practice. I am missing important information in lectures as I am finding it hard to concentrate, to change this I need to work on ways to control my anxiety.

## Week 6: 24 October
In our Comp120 class, I struggled to keep up with the lecture. I was unable to write effective code for manipulating Pixel arrays during class. I have managed to get a better handle of it from home, but need to put more practice in until I am comfortable with it. We had our first stand-up meeting, which was awkward at first but in the end we managed to use the time productively. Using Trello, we divided up the task based on people's skill-sets and people's interest but also ensured both unconfident and confident coders had some coding to work on. We also discussed how to close up the gap between coding abilities by using pair-programming to help those of us less confident with coding to catch-up.

## Week 7: 31 October 
I left our Monday lecture early this week, in my study skills appointment, we came up with a few solutions to improve my concentration and uncertainity in lectures, which I am going to try out next week. In groups, we had to present our proposals for our Agile essays, I struggled to know where to look and was unsure what software we should have been using for our presentation slides. I plan to watch a few videos online for advice on presentation skills. The peer-review session of our Tinkering Graphics code did not go well for me, I need to read up on PEP8 and clean code practices so that I can review my own and my peer's code more effectively. 

## Week 8: 7 November
We had our first sprint review for our Game Development project this week, and found that our User Stories were too broad, making it difficult to establish if a task had been completed. For next time, we need to ensure our User Stories describe the outcome needed in order to qualify the task as complete. The most challenging part of the week, was the comp120 lecture on Tinkering Audio. I struggled to understand fully what we had been asked to do, therefore I need to go over the session slides in my own time.
