abstract={This paper outlines the need for valuing of software engineering skills as a means to improve software engineering education. It presents a brief introduction to affective domain learning, and a survey of the education literature on software engineering skills related to software testing and quality assurance, which suggests that the competencies and skills needed extend beyond cognitive-domain learning. It then proposes a means for studying student valuing of these `best practice' skill areas.},
