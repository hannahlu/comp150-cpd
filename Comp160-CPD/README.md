### Challenges
* Spending most of time on group game project, falling behind on controller and essay, yet my work for group game project is not good enough to make up for this. Probably because I am in the studio fixing small bugs and helping designers, but not making a lot of progress with own work and having new tasks added to implment for game.

### Challenges
* Feeling fairly demotivated and dejected about work

* All changes made before hand in this week were lost as team member had saved project we were working on to downloads folder. A lot of changes were done along with rest of team, who are no longer working on project, so concerned as to how to replicate all the changes made
* Very behind on controller

## Areas I am struggling in
* Concentration, alone and in groups/class

* Use of Software Engineering Practices: Ontology, UML etc
* Team Work
* Stress of being social as often as required on course
